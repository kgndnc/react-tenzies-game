## Tenzies Game with React

This project is from Bob Ziroll's wonderful React course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). <br>
Based on his suggestions I added some new features:

1. Actual die faces with dots using only css (not images) instead of numbers (special thanks to Edwin Keijl for the helpful [guide](https://dev.to/ekeijl/creating-dice-using-css-grid-j4))
1. Timer that starts after clicking the first dice
1. A modal that pops up after winning the game and contains the info about the time elapsed and hi-score ranking
1. Hi-score table stored in _localStorage_ keeping the best 10 scores of the user on their local machine (_on development_)
   <br>
